# Lab 1: Getting started with data science tools

You should clone this repository to get started with this lab.  The URL to clone is [https://github.com/lse-me314/assignment01](https://github.com/lse-me314/assignment01).  **You can find detailed instructions on how to do this [here](https://lse-me314.github.io/instructions).**

### Resources

* [Lab session overview slides](lab-session/lab-session-1-slides.pdf)  
* [Lab session tools RMarkdown file](lab-session/lab-session-1.html).  To work with this yourself, you should clone the repository and try knitting the file `lab-session-1.Rmd` yourself.  This file will be available in the cloned repository, once you have followed the cloning steps.  
* A [primer on using git](lab-session/GIT), written by Christian.  

### Assignment

Work with the file `assignment/me314-assignment1-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME.Rmd`.  You should 

a)  Rename this file!  
b)  Edit the file to supply any answers requested.  
c)  Knit the file.  

If those steps worked, then you have all of the tools ready that you will need for the remainder of the course.

### Solutions

Solution to Assignment 1 as:
*  [html](solution/me314-assignment1-solution.html) 
*  [RMarkdown](solution/me314-assignment1-solution.Rmd)  

Don't worry if a lot of these operations in R were over your head.  We will take a more gradual approach building up to more complicated R code as the rest of the course progresses.  Very few students will have been able to answer all of these questions at this stage!
